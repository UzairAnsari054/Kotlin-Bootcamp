// Exception Handling is a technique to handle runtime problems and maintain flow of execution
// (eg, running out of memory, condition like divided by zero )

// Try - this block contains the code that can break. This should be followed by catch, finally or both
// Catch - this block catches the exception thrown by try block
// Finally - this block always executes so it should contain important code
// Throw - used to throw exceptions explicitly
